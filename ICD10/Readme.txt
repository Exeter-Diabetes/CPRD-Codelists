For 'exeter_icd10_genital_infection_nonspec' Andy suggested to include code B37 = Candididias where there's no decimal point
However B37 hasn't been included here as it would pick up other codes e.g. B37.1, and there are no instances of just B37 in our data

Similarly, haemorrhagic stroke doesn't include I62 and ischaemic stroke doesn't include I69 as there are no instances of these in our download and they would pick up other codes.


Haemorrhagic and ischaemic stroke codelists have extra codes which aren't in the overall stroke codelist.
